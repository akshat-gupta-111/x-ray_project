    <div class='gemini-section'><h4>AI Assistant Note:</h4>This AI has analyzed the X-ray images and identified areas that it believes could be fractures. Here's what that means and why it's crucial to see a doctor:

1.  **AI is a Tool, Not a Doctor:** Think of this AI as a highly advanced spell-checker for X-rays. It's a computer program designed to spot patterns. While it can be very good at recognizing things it's been trained on, it **does not have medical training, judgment, or the ability to understand your unique situation, symptoms, or medical history.**

2.  **"Confidence" is a Probability, Not a Guarantee:** The numbers like 0.89 (89% confident) or 0.31 (31% confident) are just the AI's internal way of saying how probable it thinks a fracture is in that specific spot based on the data it has learned.
    *   A high confidence (like 0.89 for Fracture 1) means the AI is quite sure it sees a fracture, and looking at the image, there's a very clear break there.
    *   A lower confidence (like 0.61 for Fracture 2) means it's less certain but still sees something suggestive.
    *   A very low confidence (like 0.31 for Fracture 3) means it only faintly suspects a fracture or might be picking up on something that isn't one.

3.  **This is NOT a Diagnosis:** Only a qualified medical doctor can provide a diagnosis. The AI's output is simply a preliminary **detection or suspicion**. A doctor will:
    *   **Examine you:** They'll physically check the area, ask about your pain, how the injury happened, and your medical history.
    *   **Interpret the X-ray properly:** They'll look at the images themselves, considering all angles and views, and combine that visual information with your symptoms and physical exam findings.
    *   **Determine the exact nature and severity:** If there is a fracture, they'll figure out what type it is, how severe, if bones are displaced, and if there's any other damage.
    *   **Develop a treatment plan:** Crucially, a doctor will decide the best course of action for healing, whether it's a cast, surgery, pain management, or other interventions.

**In plain English: The AI thinks there might be a fracture, especially a very clear one based on its highest confidence. However, this is just a computer's best guess based on images. You absolutely must see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and the right treatment, as only a medical professional can confirm what's going on and help you heal properly.**</div>
