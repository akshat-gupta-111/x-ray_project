    <div class='gemini-section'><h4>AI Assistant Note:</h4>It's very important to consult a doctor immediately for several key reasons, and to understand that this AI analysis is not a diagnosis:

1.  **AI is a Tool, Not a Doctor:** This AI has simply identified *areas* on the X-ray that *might* be fractures, based on patterns it learned from data. It's a sophisticated pattern recognition tool, but it doesn't have medical training, clinical experience, or the ability to understand the full context of a patient's health.

2.  **Confidence Scores Aren't Certainty:**
    *   The confidence scores (0.89, 0.61, 0.31) tell you how "sure" the AI is about each potential fracture. A score of 0.89 means the AI is quite confident it sees a fracture, while 0.31 means it's much less certain â€“ it's just a faint possibility in the AI's "mind."
    *   Even a high confidence score like 0.89 is *not* a guarantee. AI can make mistakes, and its "confidence" is a statistical measure, not a human expert's certainty.

3.  **Source of Annotation Matters:** The detections are "Provided by a Roboflow user." This indicates that the AI model or its training data may have been created or annotated by users who are not necessarily medical professionals. This further emphasizes that the results should not be considered a medical diagnosis.

4.  **Only a Doctor Can Diagnose and Treat:**
    *   A qualified medical professional (like an emergency room doctor, an orthopedic specialist, or a radiologist) is the *only* one who can officially diagnose a fracture. They will examine the X-ray, consider your symptoms, physical condition, and medical history.
    *   If a fracture is confirmed, they will determine the exact type, severity, and location of the break, and then create a proper treatment plan (e.g., casting, surgery, physical therapy) to ensure proper healing and prevent long-term complications.

**In simple terms:** Think of this AI as a highly intelligent assistant pointing out things that *look like* fractures. It's a very strong hint that you need professional medical attention, but it is **not** a diagnosis that you can rely on for treatment. You must see a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and the necessary care.</div>
